# amartyasingh-namaste-react
Learnings from Namaste React web series. 

Inside every episode there is a code directory and a notes.md file, notes contains the theory part of the course and code contains whatever was taught during the episode in a web app. If the project is too large then I will make a new repo or indicate where the code lives for that episode. 


Happy Learning!
